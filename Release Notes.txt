0.6.0-beta (2020-08-30-12-25):
	+ Added -hs --hashes option which accepts a sequence of bytes to be 
	used in checksum.
	Example: 
		python3 PosDups.py -hs 1kb,128kb,5Mb,3Gb
		This command will use file sizes first to group. Then, in order,
		applies sha512 to and groups files read in 1kb, 128kb, 5mb, 3gb sizes.

0.5.0-beta (2020-08-29-22-05):
	+ Added -fl --filterLower command line option. Given an int, filters
	files which are smaller or equal than that int in bytes.
	
	+ Added -fh --filterHigher command line option. Given an int, filters
	files which are bigger or equal than that int in bytes.
	
	+ Current multi pass sequence: file size, sha512-4Kb, sha512-128Kb
	sha512-2Mb

0.4.0-beta:
	+ Size str (B, Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb) is calculated in a function up to Tb 
	for output formatting.
-----
0.3.0-beta:
	+ Output formatting added to util.py and used crudely in PosDups.py.
